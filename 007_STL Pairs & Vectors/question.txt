
Q1) Make a fuction called explainPair and 

  i)    make a int,int pair with {2,8} called pr1
  ii)   make a int,char pair with {2,'b'} called pr2
  iii)  print first and second item of pr1 & pr2
  iv)   make a pair with it's first element being a <int,char> pair and second item being a int, called pr3
  v)    print the second item of the first item in pr3


Q2) Make a function called explainVector and printVector

  i)    make a empty vector 'vec' and push 1,2,3 inside it, print it.
  ii)   print the nummber of elements in vec
  iii)  print vec like any other array 
  iv)   print vec in reverse using iterators (without auto)
  v)    print vec using for each loop
  vi)   print vec in reverse using rbegin() and rend()
  vii)  create vec2 of size 5 but all elements 0, print it
  viii) create vec3 of size 3 but all elements 9, print it
  ix)   create vec4 with elements {7,11,13}
  x)    create a vector dupvec and copy vec4 in it
  xi)   create vec 5 with elements from 1 to 7, make another vector called sub with only 3,4,5,6 in it.
  xii)  print first and last element of sub using .front() and ____
  xiii) pop the last element of sub and print the last element again
  xiv)  create a vector vec6 with elements 1 to 8, erase 5 and print vec6, then erase {2,3,4} and print 1,6,7,8 only
  xv)   make vec6 empty
  xvi)  swap vec5 and vec6
  xvii) insert 5 into vec6 between 2 & 3
