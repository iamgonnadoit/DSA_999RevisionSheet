Sort characters by frequency

You are given a string s. Return the array of unique characters, sorted by highest to lowest occurring characters.

If two or more characters have same frequency then arrange them in alphabetic order.


Examples:
Input : s = "tree"

Output : ['e', 'r', 't' ]

Explanation : The occurrences of each character are as shown below :

e --> 2

r --> 1

t --> 1.

The r and t have same occurrences , so we arrange them by alphabetic order.

Input : s = "raaaajj"

Output : ['a' , 'j', 'r' ]

Explanation : The occurrences of each character are as shown below :

a --> 4

j --> 2

r --> 1

Input : s = "bbccddaaa"

Output:
3
Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 105
s consist of only lowercase English characters.
