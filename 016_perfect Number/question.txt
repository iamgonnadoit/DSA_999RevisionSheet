Q) You are given an integer n. You need to check if the number is a perfect number or not. Return true if it is a perfect number, otherwise, return false.

A perfect number is a number whose proper divisors add up to the number itself.


Examples:
Input: n = 6

Output: true

Explanation: Proper divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3.

1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

i) Write boolean function isPerfect() with brute force approach
ii)Write boolean function OptimalisPerferct() with Optimal approach. 

Hint : find out the divisors of 36. 1x36, 2x18, 3x12, 4x9, 6x6
