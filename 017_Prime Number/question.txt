Q1) You are given an integer n. You need to check if the number is prime or not. Return true if it is a prime number, otherwise return false.

A prime number is a number which has no divisors except 1 and itself.


Examples:
Input: n = 5

Output: true

Explanation: The only divisors of 5 are 1 and 5 , So the number 5 is prime.

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 5000

Make two functions one isPrime() and one optimalIsPrime() to solve in brute and optimal approaches respectively.


Q2) You are given an integer n. You need to find out the number of prime numbers in the range [1, n] (inclusive). Return the number of prime numbers in the range.

A prime number is a number which has no divisors except, 1 and itself.

Examples:
Input: n = 6

Output: 3

Explanation: Prime numbers in the range [1, 6] are 2, 3, 5.
