Largest odd number in a string

Given a string s, representing a large integer, the task is to return the largest-valued odd integer (as a string) that is a substring of the given string s.

The number returned should not have leading zero's. But the given input string may have leading zero.

Examples:
Input : s = "5347"

Output : "5347"

Explanation : The odd numbers formed by given strings are --> 5, 3, 53, 347, 5347.

So the largest among all the possible odd numbers for given string is 5347.

Input : s = "0214638"

Output : "21463"

Explanation : The different odd numbers that can be formed by the given string are --> 1, 3, 21, 63, 463, 1463, 21463.

We cannot include 021463 as the number contains leading zero.

So largest odd number in given string is 21463.

Input : s = "0032579"

Output:
"32579"
Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 103
'0' <= s[i] <= '9'
