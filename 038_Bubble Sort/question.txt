Bubble Sort

Given an array of integers called nums,sort the array in non-decreasing order using the bubble sort algorithm and return the sorted array.

A sorted array in non-decreasing order is an array where each element is greater than or equal to all preceding elements in the array.


Examples:
Input: nums = [7, 4, 1, 5, 3]

Output: [1, 3, 4, 5, 7]

Explanation: 1 <= 3 <= 4 <= 5 <= 7.

Thus the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Input: nums = [5, 4, 4, 1, 1]

Output: [1, 1, 4, 4, 5]

Explanation: 1 <= 1 <= 4 <= 4 <= 5.

Thus the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 1000
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
nums[i] may contain duplicate values.

Hint : In bubble sort the highest element bubbles up at the end.
