Rotate string

Given two strings s and goal, return true if and only if s can become goal after some number of shifts on s.

A shift on s consists of moving the leftmost character of s to the rightmost position.

For example, if s = "abcde", then it will be "bcdea" after one shift.


Examples:
Input : s = "abcde" , goal = "cdeab"

Output : true

Explanation : After performing 2 shifts we can achieve the goal string from string s.

After first shift the string s is => bcdea

After second shift the string s is => cdeab.

Input : s = "abcde" , goal = "adeac"

Output : false

Explanation : Any number of shift operations cannot convert string s to string goal.

Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 100
1 <= goal.length <= 100
s and goal consist of only lowercase English letters.
