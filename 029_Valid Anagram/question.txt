Valid Anagram

Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.


Examples:
Input : s = "anagram" , t = "nagaram"

Output : true

Explanation : We can rearrange the characters of string s to get string t as frequency of all characters from both strings is same.

Input : s = "dog" , t = "cat"

Output : false

Explanation : We cannot rearrange the characters of string s to get string t as frequency of all characters from both strings is not same.

Input : s = "eat" , t = "tea"

Output:
true
Constraints:
1 <= s.length , t.length <= 5*104
s and t consist of only lowercase English letters
