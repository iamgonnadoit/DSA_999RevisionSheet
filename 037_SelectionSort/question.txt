Selection Sort

Given an array of integers nums, sort the array in non-decreasing order using the selection sort algorithm and return the sorted array.



A sorted array in non-decreasing order is an array where each element is greater than or equal to all previous elements in the array.


Examples:
Input: nums = [7, 4, 1, 5, 3]

Output: [1, 3, 4, 5, 7]

Explanation: 1 <= 3 <= 4 <= 5 <= 7.

Thus the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Hint 1 : Think Small First, at each step, identify the smallest element in the unsorted portion of the array and place it in its correct position.

Hint 2 : Use Divide and Conquer Mindset, visualize sorting as splitting the array into sorted and unsorted parts, and shrinking the unsorted part one element at a time.
