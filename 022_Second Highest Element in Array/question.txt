Second highest occurring element

Given an array of n integers, find the second most frequent element in it. If there are multiple elements that appear a maximum number of times, find the smallest of them. If second most frequent element does not exist return -1.

Examples:
Input: arr = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]

Output: 2

Explanation: The number 2 appears the second most (2 times) and number 3 appears the most(3 times). 

Input: arr = [4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7]

Output: 6

Explanation: Both 6 and 7 appear second most times, but 6 is smaller.

Input: arr = [10, 9 ,7, 7]

Output:
1
